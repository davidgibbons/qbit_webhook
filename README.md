# Webhook triggered qbit_manage 

Based off official (qbit_manage)[https://github.com/StuffAnThings/qbit_manage] docker images but wrapped in a webhook to trigger it. So you can call it via the start hook in qbittorrent if they're running in different containers.

Based on the webhook pattern from (TheCatLady)[https://github.com/TheCatLady/docker-webhook]
